The game i'd try to recreate was Enter The Gungeon. (top-down, bullet-hell, shooter genre)

i'd mange to get the movement and mechanic part of the character working,
so the remaining part would be to:
spawn enemies.
be able to proceed to next room/floor.
table flips. :D

INSTRUCTIONS
WASD-keys to move.
left-click to shoot.
R-key to reload.
spacebar to jump (hold to remain in the air for longer, like in Mario Bros)
